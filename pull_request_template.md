This new branch essentially contains a new file to contain msgs for command ingest 2 along with the msgids for the app \

Description\
There is a file called cmd_ingest_2_msgs.h which contains the structs for the new command ingest 2 messages. In moonranger_msgids.h there are several msgids added in for the app\

This was required so the new command ingest 2 app would work thus creating functionality for communication with the iOBC.\

How has this been tested?
Unit tests have been created and it was built alongside the other apps.\

I tested it in a docker container within ubuntu\

It should not affect other areas of the code\
